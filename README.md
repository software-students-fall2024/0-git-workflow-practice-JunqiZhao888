[aws amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

This is a demo for aws amplify, easy for understanding and hands on, and I believe you would want to try it. AWS Amplify is a fully managed development platform designed to help developers quickly build, deploy, and manage full-stack web and mobile applications. It provides integrated solutions for both front-end and back-end, simplifying services like authentication, APIs, storage, and hosting.

Amplify supports continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, making it easier to automate deployments and updates.

## Reyhan Abdul Quayum comments

I heard trying to get AWS certifications is a good way to advance one's career prospects. AWS Amplify seems like a great way for developers to use AWS services and their software engineerign skills in a streamlined way.
